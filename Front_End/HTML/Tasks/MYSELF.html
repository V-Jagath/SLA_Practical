        <h3>Name</h3>  Jagathratchagan V
<h3>Education Qualification</h3>  M.sc Computer Science
<h3>Passed Out</h3>  2025
<h3>Aim</h3>  My goal is to get an IT job and build a successful career.
    Although I currently have limited coding knowledge, I am very interested in learning coding and exploring new technologies.
I studied in Tamil medium from 1st to 12th standard, so English communication is a bit challenging for me. 
However, I am confident and hopeful that I can improve and speak English fluently.
